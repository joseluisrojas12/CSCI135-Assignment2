# CSCI135-Assignment2
Programming project 2 for the course CSCI 135.
The instructions and requirements are in the pdf file. The sequence of codons are in the txt file. The objective is to design a DNASequence class to represent DNA sequences. The
class must provide member functions to append nucleotides in 3 different ways: (1)
in the form of codons, (2) in the form of nucleotides from codons that are
“translated” from amino acids, and (3) in the form of nucleotides from codons
“translated” from amino acids that appear in data files. Finally, the class must also
provide member functions to get back the sequence in two forms: (1) as chains of
nucleotides, and (2) as chains of translated amino-acids
